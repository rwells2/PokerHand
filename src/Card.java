 * This class represents a single playing card
 * understand that the rank is what you would see 
 * on the card (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A).
 * The value is a number corresponding to the rank
 * which gives each card a numerical value.  This can
 * be used for keeping score, putting cards in order
 * easily, etc. For our purposes, when you construct
 * Cards, the value would match the rank for 
 * ranks 2-10, then J has a value of 11, Q has a value
 * of 12, K has a value of 13, and A has value of 14.
